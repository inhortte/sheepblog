My brain is foggy with notions which are half-formed. I need to flee my workplace and hop on bus 49, on which I\'ll be sped away to a liaison (sortof) with bus 44, which will whisk me to a patch of cement which is within 7 minutes walk of my place.\r\n\r\nI should definately implement \"multiple topics\" per entry. I am wondering about the user interface, however. A comma seperated list? A list box for predefined topics? A dilemma! As for this test post:\r\n<pre>\r\n  code deleted for aesthetic reasons...\r\n</pre>\r\nThat should make things into paragraphs! I just thought of a possible problem, however. If I were posting boatloads of code, It would paragraphify it even if it were between \'pre\' tags (or \'code\' tags). Uff.

Can I enumerate the situations which have held me in limbo since then? They are not to be numbered. They cannot be. I shall go out to smoke a cigarette, down the spiral stairs and onto the parking lot. Delivery men will watch me passively.\r\n\r\nOh, the boss is here. What shall I do? If I have to sit here all day doing nothing important, I shall squeeze my own liver out of my torso and feed it to the bastards who make me live a life which is unimportant.\r\n\r\nJenicek was far away. I remember that clearly. I watched my face in the mirror in the elevator as I descended to take my cigarette. My mind was on the future. On a future that was not particularly defined (everything now seemed to me wanted defined). Vesna was at home (was it home? not really) waiting. I passed time wasting the internet with my intentions. I got no further than earning money for doing nothing. Is it possible in this case, six years later? That is a fucking good question, my friend.\r\n\r\nPetr now describes some easy to understand concept on the white-board to Jan whilst I listen to Magma in the headphones Vladimir supplied me. It is only ironic in a deadly passive way. No questions for me, for sure. I am a rock untouched by the lapping waves of questions.

The only words she has spoken to me since I returned from work were sarcastic or scurrilous. She claims her <em>mood</em> springs from our Skype chat earlier. I invited her to go to a film tonight and she asked why I liked sitting down so much. She said she\'d go, but I have to go to power yoga with her in return. I told her I would not feel comfortable in a group exercise environment (which is certainly true) and she was patently offended, it seems.\r\n\r\nWe have been wavering. For a long time now.\r\n\r\nShe treated me with this emotional icyness in the past and I endured it, always building, hoping for better days. Perhaps I was wasting my time. Perhaps she was wasting hers, as well. It is certainly an indication that our relationship is on the rocks when what were once seen as only small cracks in my personality now must shield themselves from a torrential flood from her. So she is not happy. How to let it go?\r\n\r\nShe said she was looking for a new place to live. She said she wants to leave me. It hurt. It still does a bit, but the pain is waning. As I strolled through the chilly evening from the bus-stop to our flat, I felt a smile creep to my lips as I thought of freedom.','2006-12-15 19:16:25','2011-01-15 21:48:33'),(11,'Evening in Bracknell','At this very moment, I\'d love to hear the song <em>Been Alone so Long</em> by Peter Hammill. It seems to sum up the evening though it really, rationally has not been so long since I have been alone. Just over three days. Funny how time can scrape and maul your senses. It seems like years, decades. And she transforms herself into the one who can survive her run of the mill world, the world I am very rarely allowed to see - HoneybunÃƒÂ­čka land. I am not very happy about the September memory of her calling & messaging when she was drunk in Krnov. I was with Garth then and he shared my pain. I could see it in his face. I wonder what she was really doing, why she was really unavailable. And she accuses me of being suspicious. Oh yes, I am, and after the way she talks about her obsession with sex and the way she hides every other point of her social life from me -- who wouldn\'t be suspicious? I can think of no-one.

So how is that for meta-tagging the entry? The feeling, from the beginning, is fucking intense. What a great start! What do you think, my elegant reader? I stopped the film just now. I was going to register something --- mayhap here, mayhap in yon journal, but it has escaped me. Shit.\r\n\r\nDefinately, this film burns like Acy\'s blowtorch to the leg of my cardtable back in 1991. You can feel the tension from the start. I am just to the point now where Jasper takes Faron to his place. They are about to smoke weed and listen to Radiohead. I remember so much. Fuck, that is a good idea. Oouh baby.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point is that the version of \'Goodbye Ruby Tuesday\' is sung by Franco Battiato. What the fuck kind of coincidence is that, my fine, feathered friend?\r\n\r\nI wonder when it is time to feel old. I think my parents <strong>insist</strong> that it should be soon. It was only last year that my mother mentioned to me that I should be passing into middle age soon. Stereotypes are fun, eh?\r\n\r\nThe conversation with Mike in early 1994 is important. There are people (like, as he said, Miles, who would grow old naturally and happily) who grow old and people who are damned to be young for the rest of their existence. That reminds me: I\'d be good to get in touch with him sometime soon, not only for nostalgic\'s sake.\r\n\r\nI think a large portion of the film is about forgetting people who are important. Well, perhaps that is just an ironic point of view. Ach Jo. What scratching impulse does one have when all one\'s friends have been murdered because of some absurd political reason?\r\n\r\nSo I am going to watch the remainder of the film and sadden myself because of its inhumanty.

Well, probably not ALL about, but a good deal, anyway. We were rather blasted at the time, for sure. Since then (and prior, to an extent) the feeling has washed over me that it is finally time. Of course, I have written drivel similar to that sentence a multitude of times in the past, so it may not be immediately believed. Still, the feeling floods. The floorboards of my mind are sodden. The rafters will soon be entombed in the deluge.\r\n\r\nI have never been one to be held at bay.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in an email to LucÃƒÂ­a yesterday (or was it the day before?) something concerning rent in Buenos Aires. She did not reply. Only during our short discussion today via Skype was the subject breached. One of her initial questions was \'Are you serious this time?\' I suppose it was warrented. The last year has been rather jangly concerning the rusted, decrepit chains which hold me in Brno. I suppose the Rubicon has been crossed -- at least mentally. No going back now.\r\n\r\nMichal also expressed the desire to traverse the atlantic in early summer. A joint journey could be fruitful (not to mention pretty fucking big fun) but he\'d be returning alone.\r\n\r\nSweet Entropy, are you listening?

I soon found it that Woody Allen directed it. Well, I thought, at least there is that. He usually injects a bit of depth into his films. The story turned out to be quite unexpected. I was happily surprised.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, in the end, chooses a life which is more comfortable over a life which is unstable but arguably makes him much more happy/satisfied. The film does not take any sides on this issue. It does not judge his actions. It is just a statement of what is. And I believe what Allen is trying to portray is that most people, being put in the shoes of the protagonist, would choose the same.\r\n\r\nAnother point the film makes is that it is damn near impossible to pry yourself out of a complex life -- just walk away from it -- without your whole world turning on its head, even though doing so would make you more happy in the end. It\'s the transitional phase that would suck. Badly.\r\n\r\nI never want to choose what is comfortable over what would ultimately be more satisfying.

The sound flits into my ears from my front, from my back, and from my left side. Three scratching workmates. The one behind me cracks his knuckles then emits an overly forced sounding cough while the one before me sneezes, covering his distorted maw just in time with cupped hands. The keys of my laptop click in unison with my thoughts. It\'s a simple day full of sensory input usually ignored. The small click of the joints on my glasses as I straighten them even sounds monstrous to me.\r\n\r\nI am floating in a haze. The mist is thicker from where I have come and thinning en route to my destination. Destination or Way Station. A percentage of me is already gone and this portion annexes more and more of my persona day by day.

I am to set up a way to share files. This is a fascinating concept, for sure, but time constraints (or is it possibly just laziness) have seen me balking every time in the past. This balking surrounds the creation of new groovy tunes, as well.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these will help:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Start out writing simple things.</li>\r\n<li>Make them short.</li>\r\n<li>Two to three parts only.</li>\r\n<li>Allow them to be recorded (my parts, anyway) within a day.</li>\r\n<li>Get one done before moving to another.</li>\r\n<li>Send results to Tone (or the fileshare).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI have a simple idea (which shall, of course, become part of my Seven Draperies hodgepodge) which involves 11 notes -- a simple melody in A melodic minor. This arresting (!) melody shall be played on mandolin and accompanied by a bass guitar which throughout a few simple variations will match the mandolin\'s rhythm 70% of the time (though the bass notes shall be counterpoint). At one point there will be an ostinato during which the mandolin will play the melody repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIn the background I envision sustained electric guitar notes.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a simple beginning. I just gotta write the fucker and teach myself to play it flawlessly. I suppose my adherence to mandolin practise shall assist with this.','2007-03-08 10:24:54','2011-01-15 21:52:04'),(21,'One of the seven draperies','The melody came out like this:<br />\r\na (down to) e f d<br />\r\n(up to) b (down to) e f d<br />\r\n(down to) b (up to) d f# g#<br />\r\nI was pleased when I first invented it, but feel like it could grow a bit stale over time without suitable variation. I\'ll let it spin round my head a bit longer. The melody will undoubtedly be used later as the basis for one of the \'songs\' (ie, vocal portions of the piece) with many subtle changes showing up, but I suspect the root notes will remain the same.

I undulated to the singular unadorned riffs whilst she slept. As an aside, highchool brought this album to presence. Miller and Ira were obsessed with it. Well,maybe only Miller.

But I am flying to the future. I wonder were there days when I wandered around the campus listening to this very song - the whole album - as I did \'Pleasantly Disturbed\' by Simple Minds. This is healing music, a reprieve from the loneliness which engulfs me. I drift from past to present tense. I suppose the latter is better. Other albums come to mind which had the same healing power. The aforementioned Simple Minds and \'Fugazi\' by Marillion.\r\n\r\nIt is a commentary on progress and the way it rots closeness and intimacy. It is still valid to this day - an eternal hymn.

Mostly, I want Marcie to be wide eyed at the shocking things Steve Kilbey is singing of. I am, I admit, attempting to impress because she submerges herself in words that singers croon no matter the music, atmospheric, jaunty or bland.

There is the microphone, suspended from a cable from some nut in the ceiling. We play over and over, though I know he is exasperated at my energy. He has other concerns. One piece, one that runs through my head 15 years later, over and over again, is written on paper (in the future, I think I still have most of it, though I am uncertain - unable to unearth with my clouded mind, the truth) and we play it.

It was scrapped. As I shuffled down the three steps and onto the pavement, I saw a shimmering reflection of light fall and clink sadly on the ground. A lady had dropped her keys. The keychain was a green bottle opener fastened to a ring. There were three keys on the ring. Another woman asked someone quickly if the keys were theirs, but got no reply. They lay stepped on and generally ignored during the following seconds. So I grabbed them. I walked to the crossing where I knew the lady to be - most who disembarked went that direction. I didn\'t know exactly which person the keys belonged to and was readying myself to proclaim I\'d found lost keys and were they any of yours... I was lucky. The first lady I spoke two claimed them.

The reason for this heinous crime is the extreme productivity of yesterday. The Sheep Blog is practically finished. All that remains are parsing of new messages to create proper markup (I\'m thinking of using RedCloth or BlueCloth for this, though I know absolutely nothing about them and have not even bothered thinking about Markdown or whatever it is called before) and to add an Edit page. This latter bit should be a cinch. \r\n\r\nAfter waking up blearily yesterday morning, I showered and proceeded to immediately begin work on the Sheep Blog. I must admit that I breezed through the Ajax implementations with very little problem. The only small snag was that when sections of a page are reloaded via Ajax and themselves contain calls to javascript, they do not function. That is, The content section of the Sheep Blog has one or more Entries. Beneath each entry are two links, one pointing backwards to the previous day of Entries and the other pointing forward to the following day of Entries. These links would not work when the section was reloaded (though they did initially when the whole page was loaded at once). The solution was to place all of the Ajax code in a function, which I called ajax_hovno, and to simply call the function once more from the loaded content. I admit I had to google around a bit before I realized this was the proper solution.\r\n\r\nI did an approximately an hour\'s worth of this coding at Java Jitterz, the only \'coffee shop\' in Seminole. I quite like it there, actually. And, it is a place to go to get away from the house (besides my daily walks), and getting away temporarily (or even permanently!) always improves productivity. Well, as I wrote in my \'100 Things About Me\' five years ago: Small changes, no matter how rudimentary or subtle, always invigorate me. I must admit that my biggest fear is stagnation. Yus. Which brings me to the next topic and the biggest bit of productivity for the day.\r\n\r\nI stayed up until about three in the morning working on Reprise. The night before I had written the Rhodes and String parts in Lilypond and was pretty satisfied. So, yesterday, I whipped out LMMS and programmed in the parts. It took longer than I thought it would even though there are many, many repeating phrases. It is, after all, a very repetitious song, though in a shifty, sliding manner. The repeating phrases slide over one another, some changing subtly each iteration, others remaining static. I enjoy the effect, which is fortunate since I wrote it. Heh. The original (and still current) intention was to pan each part hard to one side and throw a deep reverb on the combined result. All mixed together, I had hoped it would give the Rhodes and Strings a distant feel. It did not exactly do that, but instead made them more ambient and blurry. I have not worked out the exact mix parameters yet, but the demo I mixed down before I actually attempted to go to sleep sounds mediocre. I\'ll reuse the word \'blurry\' and call it appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe sequenced parts are three in number. Part two is nearly, but not quite, part one sliced in two. The third part is a melody of sorts which accompanies the chord progression and weird backwards/forwards guitar part which repeats and fades at the end of the piece. In the center, I created a bastardization of the vocal melody in \'Union\'. It seemed like a good thing to do at the time, somehow tying the \'album\' together. The Rhodes part will in a way be featured during the extended instrumental section in Union, making another tie. Possibly it will show up somewhere in the Loopy Unnamed Song, also. Anyhow, this part three is mixed badly. I\'ll bring the rhodes up an octive and maybe cut its bass frequencies a bit for better results. I may not actually do another mix or any modifications tonight, however, because I have plans for Intersection, which is the first piece in the sequence. \r\n\r\nAs a brainstorm before I fell asleep (which was long coming), I thought it may be good to add another song to the \'album\', that being the \'Acy Bob\' piece I wrote in the hotel whilst first in London back in February. I know I worked it out a bit later on and that Tony wrote some lyrics. The plan is to create something very simple and repetitive with a groovy beat. Yeah. A dance track! A hit! That\'d be the cute little day.','2010-12-19 20:58:52','2011-01-15 22:13:16'),(72,'The fluff of the beard on the face of the seal','Not suprisingly, I did not work at all on the Sheep Blog today. Why is that? Well, I went with my parents to the Casino an Hobbs, where I lost quite a bit of money. Well, one must have balance, right? Tuesday I came out way ahead and today, I cut my winnings in half, so, I suppose I should not complain. I am still ahead. Yeah. Exciting, isn\'t it?\r\n\r\nAt the first machine I played at the Casino, I whipped out my pocketmod and wrote down an observation I made about my father during our trip from Seminole to Hobbs. Here is what I wrote (more or less):\r\n\r\nMy father always has a very strict frame for every event which surrounds him. This is my opinion, anyway. For example, as he is always trying to teach a lesson of some kind, when we were driving from Seminole to Hobbs today, he spotted a truck hauling which seemed at first glance to be a metal construction created for some unknown purpose. He latched on to it immediately. Now, my view here is that he had it in his brain (perhaps not consciously) to present a moralistic lesson. He stated that \'that old boy\' is hauling something he built, implying (to me) by his tone of voice and general demeanor that it was a thing of value to build something with your hands and that the \'old boy\' should be proud to have done so.\r\n\r\nIt turned out, however, that the \'construction\' was just a number of metal frames, perhaps for beds, strapped together to keep them from tumbling from the trailer. My point is that he has certain constructs in his mind which I surmise he learned whilst growing up in Seminole and especially during his teen years and early 20s during which he worked hard using his hands. He bagged groceries for years. He also worked on top of an oil derrick for a long while. He expounds quite often about these years of his life to me when we are driving about Seminole on this errand or that (usually to the grocery store or post office or back, actually). Anyway, he finds value in this. I am not slighting his point of view, but I find it gets a bit tiring when he brings it into the moment sometimes subtly and sometimes not just on the spur of the moment time and time again. Using the \'old boy\' with his trailer, no matter its real contents, is just one example. He is prone to this behaviour often.\r\n\r\nI believe it was yesterday on our way back from the grocery store when he once again was talking about the time when he always had a job as a teenager and therefore always had \'two quarters to rub together\'. I let my imagination take over a bit at the time and wondered if I pursued a conversation with him (instead of being silent and just listening, as I was doing) on the topic if he\'d come to the conclusion that all adolescents would be better adjusted were they to be subjected to the same sort of lifestyle. That is, learning to work with their hands by experience. His jobs were all after school and on the weekends, leaving little time for \'extracurricular activities\'. My imagination continued and visualized me saying I believe children and adolescents are better off if they are not subjected to work and have time to explore their creativity instead. I\'d argue that a routine job would perhaps deaden their minds. I was silent, though. He dropped it after a while.\r\n\r\nA few hours ago, after nearly two years, I began finishing the piece \'Reprise\'. I like the parts I wrote (with Lilypond). My plan (I have lots of those, don\'t I?) is to put together the songs I constructed (all unfinished) two years ago as an \'EP\'. I suppose I was somewhat inspired by the \'Ships EP\' by the Bearded Seals that I purchased from Amazon yesterday evening (created by Ashley). The sequence of songs on my EP will be like this:AYB\r\n\r\nIntersection -> Untitled (the one with lots of looping and the 5/8 7/8 polyrythmic ostinato) -> (Maybe: She Ain\'t My Girl Tony/Me improv) -> Union -> Reprise Introduction -> Reprise\r\n\r\nI\'ll ask Tony to contribute bass parts to most all of it. Well, maybe not Reprise because I have an old bass part he did for it lying around somewhere. If I can use it (modified with effects or whatever), then I shall not bother him. Union has no bassline, however. Nor does any of the rest, for that matter. :) That will most likely make up about 20 minutes. I look forward to it. I can bang out the sequenced parts of the pieces pretty easily. The sequenced part of Reprise will reappear in Union, and maybe in Untitled. Oouh, baby.\r\n\r\nNow I shall munch on broccoli dipped in hummous and watch a film. Good evening to YOU.','2010-12-17 23:59:59','2011-01-15 22:12:10'),(73,'I wanna put the Psi back in Psychosis','What psychoses possesses another person to begin cleaning up the \'mess\' which is inevitable during a meal before the remaining diners have finished eating? Furthermore, what possesses them to complain, afterwards, using the ubiquitous language of emotional blackmail, that no one else does anything to keep the kitchen and dining area tidy? The other diners are surely not at fault. When dining, isn\'t it best to relax and enjoy oneself? As opposed to rushing and having the mind elsewhere (like on cleaning up the inevitable mess)? I would include this behaviour in a list of psychoses, for sure. Perhaps it sprouts from insecurity. If one can accuse others of not playing their part in household chores, one can look at oneself as somehow better than others. Or, it could sprout from the incessant need to teach.\r\n\r\nIt irritates! My father always, no matter what he is doing when he is involved with someone else in an activity, has to attempt to teach some sort of lesson (at times moral in nature). Even when we play Cribbage, every hand is not just fun and games, but has a teacher-student atmosphere. Though I love playing cards (and my father is one of the only ones I have to play cards with), it is hard for me to keep quiet at times. I want to point out what he is doing time and time again. He probably doesn\'t even realize his \'teacher\' attitude. It is most likely an ingrained habit.\r\n\r\nI\'m currently working on the sidebar of the Sheep Blog. It\'s pure JQuery at this point and being that I don\'t do JQuery very much, I am learning gobs which will soon be forgotten if I do not continue to dabble in JavaScript on a regular basis. Searching through documentation is big fun, I can tell ya, especially if part of your brain kicks you once you are on a certain page and you realize you were looking the same thing up a few months back. That brings me to Mnemosyne. I began creating entries for Rails/RSpec \'flashcards\' so I do not forget small things which are used seldom but at important junctures and have to look them up every time. So, I say to myself as I type this, \'why don\'t you do it now, Bob?\' Ok, so I\'m creating another file called \'JQuery\' and filling in some flashcards. Oouh, baby.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather choppy entry into this \'journal\'. I don\'t think I\'ll ever get used to the word \'blog\'. I wonder what the etymology of it? I believe I shall look that up at this very instant. Ah, I should have known! (Well, perhaps not.) It is short for \'weblog\', though, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary, it was not originally used for \'online journal\' at first (1994), but was instead a contraction of World Wide Web + Log. I can imagine it indicating expansive log outputs from over-zealous cron jobs, for example. Heh. I first began writing an online journal in late spring of 2000. It was a very refreshing, fruitful experience for me, though often I typed when in some manner modified. Jenicek and I drank a hell of a lot back then. When modified, however, I wrote whatever was on my mind with absolutely no censorship. My friends (Jenicek, Viking, etc) were amused and entertained by my entries, which ran the gamut from musings on networking, python/zope programming and work positives/negatives to in depth analysis of my relationships including sometimes scathing rants about the female(s) with which I was involved. While my friends read and encouraged me, some of the other people I wrote about were angered and alienated. That was good. I enjoyed that.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to the last month or so on Facebook and my conflict with Christian about completely open writing on that forum. He loves to rule his little community and control it to the best of his ability and was time and time again aggravated when I wrote something on his \'wall\' which contradicted his ideas, or when I delved into the absurdity that I am so known for loving. Well, I am now banned from commenting on anything he posts or from writing directly onto his \'wall\'. At first I was irritated at his anal-retentiveness and his need to be in control of every aspect of his very small universe. Now I smile about it. Let him enjoy his despotism.\r\n\r\nForums such as this and the Sheep Blog, which I am still working on... yes, yes... I know I should have finished by now, deny any censorship.\r\n\r\nOi! That is it for today...

So, anyone who is reading this should go out right at this moment and purchase it.\r\n\r\nI also finally procured the book \'The Black Swan - The Impact of the Highly Improbable\'. I have only gotten through the first 12 pages or so, but already it has made an impression on me. Succumbing to my own Confirmation Bias, I was delighted at his exposition on the superficiality and unfairness of our species in not acknowledging the uncelebrated heroes who actually make the greatest marks on history. Well, perhaps they do not leave the greatest marks, but prevent black marks our species might leave on history. Because events are prevented by these heroes actions, they are naturally not celebrated. I\'ve thought about this concept many times in the past and probably written about it, as well. I\'ll have to search through old journals for such dribble if I ever find the time.\r\n\r\nThe creation if the Sheep Blog is taking longer than I surmised that it would. Mostly, it is because of the authentication method. Yeah, I could avoid it, but then there is the slight chance that anyone could find the page which would allow them to make a post. So, well, the authentication has to be there. Also, there is my unlucky bane of being unable to recall procedures which were natural a very short time ago (just a few weeks!). I can lay the blame at my newness to the Sinatra/Datamapper/Blueprint trifecta, but I think it is in reality my lackadaisical mental skills. I am attempting to hone them as quickly as possible, but my years of ruination came with quite a price. At least I am a big believer in neuroplasticity. Yeah.\r\n\r\nI just talked to Hope at Hope For Wildlife in Nova Scotia and am apparently going to be in charge of their website starting very soon. My plans are to automate the whole thing. :) I hope (pun intended) that is a reasonable idea. Step one is to find a hosting site which has ruby, shell access, and a bit of storage space. Again, Sinatra will be my choice of hosting servers. Nice. Bluehost.com appears, from a cursory inspection, to be just what I am looking for. For $6.95 a month, I\'d get shell access and Ruby! Yeah. I shall have to ask them whether I can install my own gems, but I don\'t see why it\'d be a problem. On mustela-ermina, local gems go in ~/.gem. Still, I need to investigate the workings of this mechanism. Damn my fickle brain.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been working on the Sheep Blog for the last few hours (well, on and off between small snacks). Authentication is working. Signup is not needed (the only user will be me), so it does not exist. Fantastic. I am very happy with Sinatra and its quick development \'iterations\'. I should be ashamed that I am not writing tests, however. I plan to do so when I set off into the task which is Hope For Wildlife. I hope that plan comes to fruition.\r\n\r\nI took a walk through the only park (that I know of) in Seminole earlier. I attempt to do this every day. Yesterday I did not, however, because of our late arrival from the casino. My Mother is paranoid about me being out after dark. I find this exceptionally paranoid, but I don\'t worry her when I don\'t have reason to. If there is one thing I have learned from spending time with my parents is that they cannot be changed. They are set in their ways. That rock will not erode. As I wrote before, they are submerged in Confirmation Bias. They have drowned in it and been born again so as to be unable to live without it. I propose a challenge to myself - never become so set in stone. I flow like liquid. Perhaps I should also evaporate.\r\n\r\nAs I walked, I listened to music on my small Samsung mp3 player on random. The machine only possesses a 4GB capacity, so diversity is limited. I have swapped albums out only rarely since this tradition has begun, though, so I suspect that many of the tunes I hear on these walks will soak into my memory and be always associated with my cyclical journey on that wavy sidewalk. Many of the tunes seem to appear more than others, or, perhaps, they are the more \'catchy\' ones and I recall them better.','2010-12-15 23:59:59','2011-01-15 22:09:50'),(75,'Drugged and left for dead in Montana','The first order of the morning is to comment on the negative atmosphere in which I have chosen to write.

Well, I assume their bickering affects everyone in the same way it affects me, but I can, of course, not be sure.\r\n\r\nI fell asleep sorely disappointed in myself. I had a list of things I wished to accomplish and only one even came close. Still, it was also not completed. I wake up refreshed and tell myself it will be a far more fruitful day. Perhaps. We shall go to Hobbs and meander around doing little, however. I\'ll take a novel which Christopher sent me weeks ago. I\'ll begin it since it seems to call to me, lying limply on the night stand. In case we go to the casino, which I assure everyone that we shall, I shall fold a new pocketmod so that any thoughts which spill from my beta-mind will not be lost in the noise, smoke and passing minutes.\r\n\r\nAnother goal will be to create a simple blog which will do pretty much the same thing as 750words.com. I\'ll put it up on fucksheep where blog.fucksheep.org once resided. I know the code for that is still up, but it is ragged and unfinished (though functional). All I really need is a simple blog. I\'ll dump the entries table from the database and create a new table which will fuel the simple blog. I\'ve decided on sinatra for a web framework, so I must update Ruby and its various gems. Perhaps I\'ll compile Ruby 1.9.2 on fucksheep. Oh, boy. That will be fun. I wonder if it will even work. If not, I\'ll stick with 1.8.7.\r\n\r\nOne of the failed goals from yesterday was to begin writing about cognitive biases and evaluate myself in light of each one. There is an extensive list on wikipedia. Of course, I shall not go through all of them, but I\'ll guess my goal encompasses about 74%. Christopher, in our conversation two nights previous, and I decided to write about each other in the light of the cognitive biases, as well. He thought that getting an outside perspective would also be fecund. I thought the idea was splendid, but the more I imagine it, the more I believe it will be exceedingly difficult. He claims that our fundamental personality does not really change. I am worried that since we have not actually spent time in each others\' presence in a consistent fashion in many years, that the evaluation will be skewed by fragments of memories we have of each other from years ago. Well, it\'s still an interesting experiment. Yah?\r\n\r\nWriting of cognitive biases: The first one I was to expound on is Anchoring. My mother just demonstrated an interesting example of it. She asked me from the small breakfast bar who I was talking to last night before going to sleep. She then quickly added \'Tony?\' Though I answered loudly and clearly \'I was talking to Jana,\' and she was looking at me, obviously paying attention, she replied asking me if he was doing fine, obviously still having Tony locked in her mind. Of course, she could have misheard me, but I don\'t think so. I am pretty sure my parents both exhibit anchoring to an extreme. I am not sure if it is their age or just a trait of their personality. She locked onto Tony because she was expecting him to be my answer. It\'s truth before proof. I could also assume this is a Confirmation Bias on a short term. That is, her belief that I was talking to Tony was not swayed in the least by contradicting evidence.\r\n\r\nI have been informed that we are going to the casino. Well, I shall enjoy myself. I have a small shittypie full of music, so I shall be happy in that. I should snag a novel now. They are calling me to come. More later.\r\n\r\nI have returned after winning about $450. I find that I do better when I am listening to very abstract music. I especially noticed the coincidental powers of \'Blemish\' by David Sylvian.\r\n\r\nLooking through the Rspec/Sinatra pages I have discovered, I believe it will take only about 4 hours of work to put everything together I wish for the small blog. Getting up and running on fucksheep is another matter, of course, and will look into that after I have completed a working replica on mustela-ermina. I shall first write here (this is my plan) every day, then retype into the blog, revising a BIT. We\'ll see how it goes. Most likely, I\'ll eventually abandon 750words.com and put my \'morning (which are not wholly morning and most likely never will be) pages\' directly into the blog.

Well, then, you may ask why I am listening to Puccini. The answer is this: I am listening to my music collection in more or less alphabetical order. I do cheat a bit, however, especially when I acquire a new album or want to listen to something which is previous alphabetically from where I am at the moment. Anyway, I am on \'G\' at the moment and Puccini\'s first name was Giacomo. I use past tense there with great satisfaction. For, were I to use present tense, it would indicate that the world was still a more repugnant place because of this human\'s continued existence. Let us all applaud the fact that he could not create any more of his appalling works. (I await the slow dying of the raucous applause before continuing.) So, you ask once again why I am torturing myself by listening to the wretched excuse for a composer, even if I am listening to my collection in alphabetical order? I have told myself many times that I should give each artist (or idiot, in this case) a few chances before purging them from my collection. I fear (and I use that word with utmost sarcasm) that this will be Puccini\'s final chance. Of course, that means I must suffer through Il Tabarro (which I am doing as I type this) and Il Trittico (which I shall do at some not too distant future point in time). If the latter does not redeem him in any manner, my hard drive shall be cleansed of his presence. And that is enough about that.

What value are education, breeding and talent if one doesn\'t have a pot to piss in?\r\n\r\nI\'d say the latter is of value no matter your situation. I am being broad in my definition of \'talent\', however. Perhaps you have a talent for adapting and surviving. Your skill at adapting and surviving will be honed by this raw talent. Improvisation is something which may be learned (ie, education) and can also contribute to survival skills. I\'m not sure about breeding, though again it depends on your connotation of the word. Since the book is set in the first half of the 20th century (so far - I have not completed the novel), \'breeding\' is emphasized. There are many comparisons between the \'white\' races and \'mongrel\' races implying the former are superior and the latter uncivilized sometimes to an extreme degree. This was greatly impressed on me during the first \'tale\' in the book.\r\n\r\nAs for the pot to piss in, I\'d argue that you can better yourself no matter your situation. The only people not bettering themselves are ones falling into malaise and idleness because of routine, stagnation or despair. I can imagine myself living under a bridge, but still scavenging enough coins to keep my supply of pens from dwindling. My current handwritten journal is far from complete. I\'m not sure how well my laptop would fare under a bridge, however. Heh. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, though I do have a pot to piss in (at my parents\' home), I am in desperate straights concerning funds. Though I do search (not as frantically as I would were I living under a bridge) for a job daily, I spend the remaining time staving away idleness and at least writing here, creating the Sheep Blog (which is pretty much finished, by the way, and I am copying each of these entries into it after completing them), and soon beginning work on the Hope For Wildlife website.\r\n\r\nThat is not to mention the music.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening, I began writing the bassline to \'Union\', another piece in the cycle begun two years ago (more or less).

Of course, this will be soon merged with the Sheep Blog, so the last sentence is half superfluous. But, anyway, creating a list of every number which has digits which add up to *i* was big fun, though ultimately pointless. Having the values of *f(n)* does nothing for me because with each of them I\'d have to calculate the *n*. The sheer amount of computation involved is staggering. Furthermore, to get each *f(n)* for `i = 150` takes longer than it would to pull a tugboat full of raving mustelids from here to South Africa without encountering any water or poisonous snakes.\r\n\r\n### So!\r\n\r\n*I hope you have noticed that I have begun writing these entries (starting today) with markdown since the Sheep Blog uses BlueCloth to create the fucking html from fucking text.

Now, this creates a map with only one entry for each *i* (which is *sf(x)*). Since I am being sequential in my *x*s (note the `[1..z]`), the first time a *x* results in an *i* (*sf(x)*), it is recorded. Any further duplicate *sf(x)*s are ignored. I think this is the correct step forward (as opposed to the false stagger in a random direction earlier) even though when attempting to find *i*s up to 1 000 000, it was taking so long I had to interrupt the process. I need to create a more efficient way of making this map. I have some shades of ideas, but they are still murky.\r\n\r\nI shall continue after returning from an excursion to \'Southern Rose\' with my parents for dinner. Yum.... I suppose.\r\n\r\nI have returned. Actually I returned over two hours ago. What have I done since then? Well, unfortunately, I have not forgotten about Project Euler and my little problem (cue the song, though it has little to do with mathematics). I played Hand and Foot with my parents (I came out on bottom and do not mind in the least), consumed some oatmeal cookies (much to my tummy\'s chagrin) and wrote a program.\r\n\r\nI had this brainstorm whilst at the restaurant, actually. There was a book I espied in Luxor in Praha back in, um, most likely 2007. It was about sharpening discursive skills or some rot of the like. I enjoyed thumbing through it and desperately wanted to purchase it because I felt my quickness of mind has been dulling like a blade scraped repeatedly on porous rock. Yeah. Like that. Unfortunately, when I next returned to the bookstore, I could no longer locate the tome. I did remember a point from it which stuck with me and has taken me over three years to implement. *insert smiley*. The book suggested doing a number of simple arithmetic problems quickly every morning consistently. I always liked the idea, but have, as I just wrote, and you know I love repeating myself, procrastinated until about 30 minutes ago in employing the method in any sort of tangible manner.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote the program. It is called `daily_arithmetic.rb`. Any fool can see that I wrote it in Ruby. I really should have done it in Haskell, instead, but IO in Haskell flummoxes me terribly, as very few of you know.

I wish to flesh it out and shall exude mellifluous energy from my beta-brain into LMMS and Audacity. I think I will not even bother with Lilypond. The spirit of the original \'composition\' was one of spontaneity. Jesus Christ Mother Of Satan And His Holy Bedfolk, I do not even recall what key (if any) it is in. Perhaps that 7/8 5/8 ostinato was an A and a.... well... I am not sure, actually. Doesn\'t this \'unknowing\' make it more exciting, however? I am babbling away. So have nice evening.','2010-12-22 21:54:17','2011-01-15 22:17:19'),(80,'Pipe wrench, smouldering corpse, floor','This evening I am going to revisit the thoughts I scribbled down, usually quickly, in my first pocketmod last week. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I wrote has to do with a currently \'on pause\' project, that being the novel I began in November. On November first, in fact. I was inspired by another writing site. Actually, it was the site which recommended this very site on which I am writing now. [This](http://www.nanowrimo.org/user/738589 \"My fucking book\") is it! I got a little past 25 000 words (I think - I may be fooling myself now that I consider it) and then lapsed into lethargy. Ok, that is not exactly true. What actually happened was that I went to Austin and the sheer *excitement* of being in that city which runs orange with nostalgia and inspiration entwined did not let me concentrate on novel-writing. You must admit that writing a book is a very solitary profession. During the first half of November, during which I wrote persistently every day, I was alone. There is little to distract in Seminole, Texas. It was easy to imagine the adventures of the Beast and of the unnamed main character and of Natascha, Nivalis, Houmlessak, Jonatan, Shambal and various other odd individuals (not to mention the un-individuals, that is, the seething masses gazing at passing trains, spanning platforms with their centipede-like bulk. Oh, yes, the novel was (still is) about the ambiguity of personality and its merger into larger forms (ie, society in all of its forms, from peer groups to nations).\r\n\r\n#### But I meander.\r\n\r\nThe first bit in the pocketmod states this: *Map out the path the beast took towards the leaving of his lady!* The beast was one of the original ideas when the novel (first conceived as a short story) took seed in my sloshy brain. He was initially a television commercial about anti-lubricants for women who just got too sopping wet down within that crevice-thing they have. The idea if him (it?) morphed. In several parts in the novel (which is unnamed, as you may have imagined since I call it repeatedly \'the novel\'), the beast, from within a projection or a television, elaborates on various goods which are supposed to help the main character along on his \'journey\'. It\'s more of a sojourn or a pilgrimage, actually. This beast is accompanied by a she-beast who usually just howls, makes rude gestures and provides various other visual accompaniments to the beast\'s soliloquies. What is going to happen at some point is the main character and the beast will sit and actually converse. They\'ll spill their guts to one another. The precursor to this activity is the beast\'s she-beast leaving him. I still have not actually traced the path to that juncture, however. I can assume the beast irritated the beastess by taking the stage and hogging it one too many times, for example. I still want to let it lie. Inspiration shall strike at some point, I feel assured.\r\n\r\nNext - \"Sometimes I feel I could live in West Texas just because of the sunsets. The colours, though washed out pastels they may be, are irresolutely striking. Now, to continue my walk.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to add to that, is there? I imagine many fans of West Texas to claim the sunsets here are indeed some of the best (if not *the* best) on earth. I\'ll have to agree they are magnificent. They don\'t hold a candle to the ones up north (I\'m thinking Alaska), however. So *fuck you*, fellow Texans. This place is a blight and should be erased from existence! Yes!\r\n\r\n### Fuck Texas.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to a peripheral point. My mother mentioned the other day (I think yesterday, in fact) that one day I\'ll have to take care of this house because I\'ll be the one living in it. I considered this. How would my life be at that point? I suppose I\'d be quite a bit older. They\'d be in the cemetery just out of town. I\'d convert the living room into a studio. I\'d be stocked up on booze just in case it would help with inspiration. Christopher would come stay for a few weeks and we\'d have a grand time. Tony would visit and we\'d create marvellous music. Most of the time, however, I\'d be alone, sequestered in this nook on the bleak side of the earth and on the barren side of the universe. I\'d continue my programming projects. Maybe I\'d actually become proficient on an instrument... ? Thinking about it is calming, I suppose, but it is also the easy way. It is a lapse into lethargy. Hm.\r\n\r\nMy 750 words are up! Now, I shall continue my adventure with the Loopy track. It needs a better name. Do you have any suggestions?','2010-12-23 23:29:24','2011-01-15 22:18:15'),(81,'The disintegrating guitar in my left ear is beguiling','Hello, Irritating Day! I am irritated at you. You are, as some say, an irritant. So, yesterday evening, if I failed to mention it in yesterday\'s writing, which, if I recall, had very little or nothing to do with what I actually did during the day, I signed up for the hosting service \'Bluehost\' because those using their service have SSH access. Well, this excited me. I want to host all my Sinatra apps somewhere (besides Fucksheep, which I haven\'t pursued so much lately, though I shall at some point). Let\'s concentrate on that parenthetical statement for a bit here. I just checked the Apache configuration file on Fucksheep and see that if I run an application on port 6666, it will be accessible at blog.fucksheep.org, and if I run an application on port 9090 (or something like that), it will be accessible at polaris.fucksheep.org. Well, this happifies me. I\'ll set up the Sheep Blog there and maybe also on Bluehost.\r\n\r\n#### Ok - Bluehost\r\n\r\nI transferred martesmartes.org from limedomains (which was a waste of time and money) to Bluehost. I also snatched martesmartes.net from out of the flux of unclaimed domain names. What has caused my frustration during the past few hours is attempting to get the Hope For Wildlife site up and running on Bluehost. I want it to be accessible at hfw.martesmartes.org so that Allison and Hope can take a look at my progress and comment during the development (which is happening every day now!). I need their feedback so I do not have to backtrack. Well, this is understandable and even a small Nigripes would understand so I shan\'t continue about such matters. What is important is that it *doesn\'t fucking work*. I am getting an `Internal Server Error` and am unsure how to track it since the site works fine on *Mustela-Ermina* and logging doesn\'t seem to have any effect on martesmartes.org. Perhaps I just burned myself out. I am stepping back at this moment and shall reconsider the matter either tomorrow morning (if I have time before we are all off to the Casino in Hobbs) or in the evening. After I achieve functionality of one Sinatra app, any following one will be a cinch. That reminds me that I should snatch up thirstily siralfrediv.org and siralfrediv.net.\r\n\r\nAfter writing yesterday evening, I began working on the Loopy piece. Before going into details, however, I\'d like to address my lack of creativity in *naming* the pieces. We have *Intersection* and *Union*, both of which I like, but we also have *Loopy*, *AcyBob* and *Reprise*, all of which are not to my liking. An idea was to name everything from set theory (note the first two names), but I glanced through the Haskell Data.Set library and found little, unless I want to name something \'foldr\'. Hm. Actually, that is a good idea. I\'m going to rename \'Reprise\' to \'Foldr\'. It is a smooshed together piece containing many of the ideas in pieces which will come before it on the album. So, that is that. I\'m happy I have achieved something by creating this paragraph. It amuses me that I am actually using themes from *Foldr* as I complete the other pieces. The result is the same. I\'ll continue the naming convention when I get into *AcyBob*. Let\'s take a look through the Data.Set library once again to see if we can find something which adequately describes *Loopy*. So wait a moment. Ok. I am going with *Filter*. The piece is a number of ideas tied together by a single theme, which is the 5/8 7/8 ostinato and simple atmospheric chords which churn on for long stretches. Yes. *Filter* it is. And I shall call *Foldr* just *Fold*.\r\n\r\nAfter completing this, I\'ll do my best to finish *Filter* to the extent that I finished the other pieces (that is, not really at all, but good run throughs and fleshing outs to be considered even closer on second scrutinies). Here are my notes:\r\n\r\n7/8\r\n\r\n* 2 cycles of \'groove\' - 5 measures each.\r\n* 4 cycles of \'groove\' - with birds guitars.\r\n* 2 cycles of nothing - with ascending tuneless guitar\r\n\r\n	5 measures of 7/8 and 7 measures of 5/8.\r\n\r\n	I want to add rhodes at the first of each measure.\r\n* 6 cycles of \'groove\' - That\'s 15 bars of 7/4 or 30 of 7/8.\r\n\r\n	21 measures of 5/4 with 5 beat guitar phrase repeating. E\r\n\r\n	Put rhodes and drum on every other beat.\r\n\r\n	Starts at 37.\r\n\r\n	37 + (5 * 21) = 142.\r\n* 4 cycles of \'groove\' - with atmospheric guitar in repeating 7/8. A\r\n\r\n	This is where the BEAT kicks in.\r\n\r\n	Make a string melody for this. Perhaps Tony-vocal.\r\n* 4 cycles of \'groove\' - with atmospheric guitar in repeating 5/8. D\r\n\r\n	Add some strangeness to this. Let the rhodes do something simple.\r\n\r\n	Like some \'jazz chords\'.\r\n* 2 cycles of \'groove\' - with atmospheric guitar in repeating 7/8. G\r\n\r\n	There is a distorted guitar during this, but take it out.\r\n\r\n	Add string melody for this.\r\n* 2 cycles of \'groove\' - with nothing over it. F\r\n\r\n	Add rhodes stuff from Reprise, but it 5/8, plus strings.\r\n* 2 cycles of \'groove\' - with atmospheric guitar in repeating 7/8. G\r\n\r\n	There is a distorted guitar during this, but take it out.\r\n\r\n	Add string melody for this and Tony vocal.\r\n* 4 cycles of \'groove\' - with nothing really over it. Ees\r\n\r\n	More rhodes stuff from Reprise. Various craziness.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to me! Initially, I\'ll finish the bass lines. They are simple and groovy. Tony will approve. The madness parts will be the most interesting. The melody which Tony will sing (and the string part will play, though probably not at the same time) will echo the melody in *Fold* of either the bass or the middle tritone portion.\r\n\r\nGood evening.','2010-12-24 22:53:41','2011-01-15 22:19:16'),(82,'The Circles Of Horus','In the book *Cloud Atlas* by David Mitchell, I read a line today which goes like this: *If people praise you, you\'re not walking your own path*. Now, I love this. It is what differentiates *Carpenters* from *Artists*.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is extreme to have no one ever praise you and there may be a thin line some may see between what is innovative and what is utter shit, but that line is not universal, and I care not for the manner by which most draw such a line. I am thinking at this moment of my music (more exactly, mine and Tony\'s music) and how I was told time and time again back in the old days that I should always listen to every one\'s opinion about each piece and change it accordingly to please as many as possible (of my friends, of course, who were pretty much the only ones listening, anyway). I never should have listened to this and certainly do not now. I am happy that Tony and I do not interfere with each others\' compositional process. We seem to both appreciate the other. We do make suggestions at multitudes of points. Some are employed. Others are sloughed away. I think we are walking our own path.\r\n\r\n#### Why do I suppose we are?\r\n\r\nWhat contradistinguishes *Artists* from *Carpenters* is the process of creation. The former is inspired, sure, by myriad sources, but he melds those inspirations into a whole, making it his own. He invents using tools. At times he even forges his own tools to invent with. And so on. He is the architect and sometimes also the builder of these designs. And, most importantly, he does not try to *please* anyone but his own inner muse. Therefore, he walks his own path. Whether he receives *praise* or not for his creation is not an issue for him. He has created. He moves on to create more.\r\n\r\nThe *Carpenter*, on the other hand, which is what most people are who call themselves mistakenly *artists*, has a scheme in mind. He has a plan laid out for him. He is its slave. The room for expression is minimal. Though he feels he is inserting some of his own artistry into the technique he has learned to mimic over hours, days, months, years of practise, he is mistaken. A *Carpenter* is just a tool for an *Artist*. They are, as the tired saying goes, a dime a dozen.\r\n\r\nI recall a heated conversation in Polo back in most likely 2005 where Christian, Karolina and I discussed the idea of *Carpenters* and *Artists*. Christian wanted to insert a new category - a *Composer* - which is right above *Artist*. He is an imbecile. He wants to be called an *Artist*, and so do most of his ilk, but they are all carpenters. They are trained monkeys just like guitarists whose muscle memory is flashier than their brain\'s computational power.\r\n\r\n#### Part 17\r\n\r\nAfter the Xmas excursion to Hobbs and its Casino, I am sitting again in my bed. It is my normal location at this time of the evening. I am not ashamed of this routine yet. I have found vigor in it lately, though I know it will stagnate me if perpetuated for too long. Already I feel a nag in some twitching neuron telling me to rest from music making this evening and break the habit. I may do just that. Tomorrow I may go to Java Jitterz and create there for a while, despite the slushy noise within the establishment. If I am still working on *Filter*, it may contribute.\r\n\r\nApproximately two hours were spent working on the Hope For Wildlife web site. It is running now on Bluehost [here](http://hfw.martesmartes.org \"Hope For Wildlife\") after a bit of wily debugging! The main problem was the request.path was having `/dispatch.fcgi` prepended.

If inspiration smacks me, I\'ll contradict this stance, of course. One decision I reached today regarding it was to actually add a piece _after_ *Fold*. If you have been living within my brain for the last two years, this radical idea may come as a near electrocution for you, but it makes sense to me. I wrote about it also in my pocketmod whilst taking my almost daily cleansing stroll about the Seminole park. The inspiration was in part from *Filter* and its portion which has the snare and rhodes bashing away on *off*_beats_, and from *Les Cercles d\'Horus* by _Univers Zero_, which I listened to at the casino.\r\n\r\nI shall continue *Cloud Atlas* now.\r\n\r\n[hfw]: https://github.com/inhortte/hopeforwildlife \"Hope For Wildlife Github\"','2010-12-25 21:50:34','2011-01-15 22:20:34'),(83,'Enjoy What I Do, Bastard, Or Die','Wikipedia states that the **Authority Bias** is *the tendency to value an ambiguous stimulus (e.g., an art performance) according to the opinion of someone who is seen as an authority on the topic*. I am strongly affected in a negative manner when people around me exhibit this bias, whether it is towards me or towards others. I find it ignorant and at times sycophantic. One good example follows Wikipedia\'s description. Many people I have known trust a musician\'s opinion of a piece of music and especially whether it is worthy of the term *art* more than what they may consider a \'normal\' person. I have found, however, that when it comes to taste in a particular art form (media that can only be evaluated in a subjective way, I find, is best for exemplifying the appearance of this bias), one who is a practitioner of the particular art form has no better taste than a said commoner. True, they may have been exposed to  more details in the realm of that art form (and especially in a particular *genre* of that art form) and know more about the technical details of creating the form, but I certainly do not place their opinion any higher than any one else\'s. A commoner - one who knows almost nothing about the creation or structure of such a form - can often offer an opinion which would never come to a practitioner\'s mind, which is often entrenched in training and rigidity.\r\n\r\n#### Rancour.\r\n### Dodecahedra.\r\n## Grisly dinner guest.\r\n\r\nI just finished an article on the **Projection Bias**. My mother exhibited a facet of this bias earlier today. As did my father. I\'ll say that they did in conjunction. They conjoined in this bias, cooperating in its use. I was at the receiving end of the bias. This is how it went:\r\n\r\nMy mother has diabetes. She and my father are worried that I, also, have diabetes. I am no stranger to this fixture of my mother (and of hypocondriacs, of which my mother is not one) to project her ailments fictitiously onto those around her and use this imagination to worry and stress herself. I agree that she had a semi-plausible reason for coming up with my pseudo-disease in the first place. I do act as if I am constantly thirsty. I consume bottle after bottle of water and carbonated beverage after can of carbonated beverage. This fact also causes me to urinate incessantly. I\'m not sure this is a symptom of the onset of diabetes, but constant thirst certainly is. My ex-friend [Zuzana](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1167667839 \"Zuzana\") realized she was a victim of this unpleasant malady when, night after night, she awoke every hour to hour and a half with a painfully parched tongue and throat. This endless need to quench her thirst led her to consult a physician. So she discovered she had diabetes. Great. Well, not great for her, but great for the theory that constant intake of liquid may be a bad sign. This, coupled with the *Projection Bias*, motivated my mother to motivate me to check my blood sugar. Happily, I found it is very normal. So. That ends that debate. For now, anyway!\r\n\r\nI\'ll also extend this idea of the **Projection Bias** to my ex-friend [Christian](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1394927580 \"Fuckup\") who finds that if he is fond of a snatch of music or a particular painting, then pretty much anyone would and should be also a fan of it. I recall a demonstration of this tendency of his at the small coffee shop in Letna (I forget its name) which serves excellent quiche. We were there (dining on quiche) with his friend [Milena](http://www.milenaoda.com/ \"Milena\") and listening to some of the raw tracks I had recently written and recorded. (These happen to be the ones I am completing during this very stretch of time, actually.) After her rejection of *Fold* (then either unnamed or called *Reprise*), Christian insisted that she\'d enjoy the improvisation *She Ain\'t My Girl* because he claimed to enjoy it so much. From Milena\'s obvious extroverted and immediate personality, I was rather sure she would not have the patience for even 30 seconds of the piece. Christian was projecting his own likes onto her. In fact, he is not the only one who is susceptible to this among people I have known. It is sometimes impossible for a person to understand how another cannot appreciate a certain piece of art (a novel, a song, a photo, a painting...) in the same way they do. I hope I do not exhibit this bias any longer, but I am sure I did in my younger days. I even recall an exact thought where I was in almost despair because someone I cared for dearly (or was obsessed with - same thing) did not appreciate a piece of music in the same way or to the same intensity that I did. The music was *Recycled* by **Nektar**. Why I remember this moment, I know not. Interestingly, this may have been the spark which led me to take account of this aspect of my personality, take it in hand, and slowly remove it from my psyche. Perhaps.','2010-12-26 20:27:02','2011-01-15 22:21:11'),(84,'A Sealed Womb','I enjoy bitching about the despotism that was always a part of my ex-friend Christian and began manifesting itself more and more in his personality throughout the years.

I believe that is what Christian, in his despotism, is attempting to create. The people who inhabit his world are to be sealed away from outside influence at all costs.

The others are all tied together with the idea of multiple users and their ability to each post and each comment on others\' posts. That is, it will take more planning.\r\n\r\n*Topics* will only add one column to the entries table (a `topic_id`). A *general* topic will exist which will be used for any post which is topic-less. On the right will be a collapsible list of topics and once one is clicked, only posts of this topic will be included in `#content`. The current topic will be indicated at the top of `#content` along with a `clear topic` link which does as one would expect.\r\n\r\nI shall have to go through the old entries of my ex-blog and take their topics to be used in the Sheep Blog. (Entries from the old blog have already been transferred). Eventually, I\'d like to get all my archives from [Livejournal][lj] and have them be a part of the Sheep Blog, as well. Another idea is to slowly type entries from written journals into the database. This will take time. Hm. I need to begin experimenting with images within the blog, as well. I have not properly tested Markdown in this manner. Well. I guess we can try it now, eh? Here we go.\r\n\r\nSo, we\'ll have to see just exactly what this does when the page is rendered.

Actually, that is untrue. The original sketch from last February is finished (I love those verse melodies) and some \'middle music\' exists, though I cannot recall exactly what it sounds like. I am thinking I\'ll go the 80s Crimson way and jump from part to part with no real warning or \'proper\' transitions. Yus! Marvellous, I must say, sweaty-one.

I believe it is from another Alfred track, however, so my plagiarism is a desirable crime. I assume at this point the bass will be playing eighth-note triplets on *f* and this melody will be much too consonant. If the next line, which goes like this,\r\n\r\n    and the sangria and soup will pour\r\n\r\nis during the triplety *e* part, the same or slight variation of this melody will still be too consonant, so I may somehow shift it, including the *bes* which is a tritone of the *e*. I am still not sure if this **triplety** (see a few entries ago) part will only have these two notes in the bass or wander off into other realms.

He exhibits this tendency almost daily in differing quantities. Today, I am absolutely sure that he didn\'t even have time to consider before his response was uttered.\r\n\r\nIt is their anniversary. Less than an hour before my announcement that I would have dinner with Sandy, my mother had stated that they would celebrate their 43rd in Ruidoso this weekend. We are all going to Ruidoso together. But, once I received the message from Sandy and opened the door to the garage where my parents were smoking to inform them of my evening plans, my father\'s immediate response was something along the lines of *\"But we are going to do something tonight for our anniversery.\"* Now, of course there had been no plans I was aware of, and my mother had stated that their \'celebration\' would be in Ruidoso this weekend, anyway. Why does he do this? Why does anyone? My first thought is that it is a gut reaction to his perception of a loss of control of a situation (though there wasn\'t really a situation; it was concocted spontaneously in his mind).\r\n\r\nThe [Emotional Blackmail][1] page on Wikipedia lists four types of emotional blackmailers. My father pretty much falls in the first of these. They are:\r\n\r\n* The punisher\r\n* The self-punisher\r\n* The sufferer\r\n* The tantalizer\r\n\r\nA punisher will, regardless of the situation, attempt to take control of the situation by emotionally manipulating its participants. Loss of control is their greatest fear. I\'ve found that resisting this sort of blackmail is to not take the person seriously and even just laugh at their attempts at manipulation. Of course, this becomes more and more difficult proportionally to the size of the group involved, as one individual resisting becomes a weaker and weaker voice. Another defence (and a defence to any of the types of listed emotional blackmail) is apathy. Well, that is a defence to pretty much anything, correct? :)\r\n\r\nI have been guilty of being the third type of emotional blackmailer many times in the past. Realizing this fault of mine again and again, however, I have done much to purge this \'feature\' of my personality. Bastard upbringing. However, I am certainly not the only guilty party. Pretty much every girlfriend (and wife) I\'ve had in the past have employed this method to some degree. And at times frequently and in a manner which was wholly *unfair* (yes, unfair in my perception, which is the one that counts in this case).\r\n\r\nSoon I shall enter a vehicle and use it to transport myself to Andrews whereupon I\'ll have dinner with Sandy.

I\'d like to actually play some of them, despite occasional (or even frequent) timing inaccuracies. \r\n\r\nOk. I have decided to work on *Cycle* after this entry has been done. Which part, you ask? Well, the second of the five parts I outlined yesterday, I reply. So let\'s begin brainstorming, shall we? It begins with the *f* triplet ostinato. The electric piano ostinatos over this with an *F major7* on beat one and a *Bes 7* on beat two. High in the background are the keys playing a *c*, then a *bes*, then an *a*. We\'ll see how that works. The electric piano continues its ostinato, but the bass moves down a half-step to *e*. Let\'s let the keys part remain the same, as well.\r\n\r\nWhen the *f* bass ostinato returns, the vocals begin with the melody I outlined yesterday. The second line of lyrics continue when the *e* ostinato appears. The third and final line (of verse one) sees the bass float down another semi-tone to *ees* but all else stay the same. The bass will traverse back to the *e* ostinato. Perhaps the whole thing repeats at that point. *f* *e* *f* *e* *ees* *e*. When *King Lindorm* by **Guapo** (a band whom everybody loves) completes its sonic manoeuvers in my ears, I shall map out this small but poignant idea in lilypond and listen to the results.

First of all, there is Cycle. Parts I, II and IV are pretty much compositionally complete and tonight I shall focus on part III. One must consider that part V is a reflection of part II, part VI is a reflection of part II, and part VII is a reflection of part I, so they may, in the possibly best (or possibly worst - details to follow) case, write themselves, in a sense.\r\n\r\n#### But how could that be a bad thing?\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, the reflective parts writing themselves would exemplify laziness on my part. As I stroll or as I shower or as I fall asleep, I ponder arrangements of these reflective portions of the piece. Mostly I think of key changes. That would add a subtle tension to the proceedings and bat down the monotony a tad. Another idea could be unexpected chord jumps in the middle of seemingly safe territory. IE, in the middle of parts VI or VII. The last recitation of the first verse melody in a key other than F major may be a delight.\r\n\r\n##### But part III awaits.\r\n\r\nComing from part II, there is the root progression of `f e ees e`. Over the final e, the ostinatos are `a f e g e f e f` and `a bes /c e d/ bes a /f a g/`. This leaves me with a vague \'chord\' rooted in e. The first thought is to move the outer pitches a whole tone and the inner pitches a semitone, resulting in `d e gis b` - an **E7** - and could begin a bluesy feel. I believe I shall stick with it. The progression can be `E7 A7 B7`. But I want to insert intermediary chords, but first, the ostinatos over each chord! For **E7**, I\'ll go with `gis a ais b ais a`. For **A7**, the \'root\' drops a half-step: `g a ais b ais a`. And **B7** lets it flutter down one more for `fis a ais b ais a`.\r\n\r\nThe *ais* I use is what my ex-guitar instructor (whose name I forget, though I believe it to be John) termed the blue note. These were the only formal guitar lessons I ever took and I possibly learned more from this human than from any other musician I\'ve ever cared to pay attention to. Perhaps that is an overstatement in hindsight (which cognitive bias is that, stupor-boy?), however. I savoured those lessons. I still owe the bloke 25 bucks. Heh.\r\n\r\n#### Now, for the intermediary chords!\r\n\r\nI shall only choose two of these. They will be stuck in here and there in a slipshod sort of manner so the whole shebang appears a tad random. (One must realize that this is the second time I am typing this paragraph. The dreaded accidentally drag the thumb across the \'mouse\' and hit a key so everything disappears event occured.) The two chords are **Bes major7** and **Gm7**. Notice that they both contain the blue note.\r\n\r\n* E7 - 4 measures\r\n* A7 - 2 measures\r\n* E7 - 3 measures\r\n* Gm7 - 1 measure\r\n* B7 - 2 measures\r\n* A7 - 1 measure\r\n* Gm7 - 1 measure\r\n* E7 - 4 measures\r\n* Bes major7 - 2 measures\r\n* A7 - 2 measures\r\n* E7 - 2 measures\r\n* Gm7 - 2 measures\r\n* B7 - 4 measures\r\n* Bes major7 - 2 measures\r\n* A7 - 1 measure\r\n* E7 - 2 measures\r\n\r\n##### Repeat that 4 times.\r\n\r\nSomeone reading this may be wondering which ostinato I shall use when playing one of the intermediary chords. I choose right now for it to be the ostinato of the following non-intermediary chord. Yuppers. So, off to lilypond to see what we have.\r\n\r\nSo, it is done. Well, not done, but an idea has been written. The rhodes plays the chords on the chord changes as indicated in the above list. The bassoon does the ostinatos under the chords so there are continuous running eighth notes. The bass plays a stumbling and rolling game underneath the two of them. When the sequence is repeated twice, I believe it should transition into part IV. As I have written in a previous entry, the transitions will be sudden. Using timidity, I created a wav from the four midi files and will now listen to the whole thing strung together.

The first through is that the reason is because of an excess of food. It weighs. My digestive properties as an organism have taken over and excused my brain from anything but involuntary functionality. How shall I banish this feeling? My first thought is to pick up the book Pragmatic Thinking and begin it again. I had read about one third of it by the time I had left Austin a month ago. The time was spent in Barnes and Noble and Borders. Therefore, I was not given the luxury of actually owning the tome as I do now. Bizarre how enthusiastic I was about it at the time and now it just sits latently on the \'bookshelf\' atop the chest o\' drawers. I\'ll whip it out in a while. In fact, I\'ll take it down now and put it on the bed beside me so I am less likely to create silent excuses later in the evening. I shall do the same with the keyboard so it sits at my side.\r\n\r\nSo, in my efforts, I have completed the music to Cycle part I. It is scant. It is minimal. I like it. And it will sound so much better with the drums. I look forward to my LMMS experience with it. I could actually do that this evening, but I am pretty sure I shall not. My lethargy is fading a tad. My impatience is growing. Hm.\r\n\r\nThe ideas for a \'melody\' on part III came to me at one point either in the morning or during the middle of the night. The melody from part I will be reprised during parts III and V, skewed to the correct key. The melody is certainly fun, so I have no problem repeating it in other forms. I had also decided to have it as the vocal melody for the last track of the album (as yet unnamed), and I wonder how difficult it will be to use it, yet remain serene. The last track needs to be serene.\r\n\r\nHowever, the last note of the last track will be a choked and missed glissando which fails to have a proper resolution. I\'ll give it to one of the harsh key sounds I found earlier whilst exploring the programs in the qsynth default soundfont. Oouh, baby.\r\n\r\n#### I was wrong. The lethargy is still oppressive.\r\n\r\nThis is from my first pocketmod:\r\n\r\n> I remember whilst I was young, possibly pre-10, I was watching a war movie\r\n> on TV. During one part the survivors were making a very big deal about the\r\n> one guy left alive up there and needing to go save him. I thought to\r\n> myself, and I recall this clearly, It\'s only one guy. What\'s the big deal? \r\n> What does this have to say about some fundamental part of my personality?\r\n\r\nWhat, indeed, does it have to say? Christian always called me a sociopath. The definition of sociopath at the free dictionary is Now, this is pretty dire. So anyone who is an introvert is a sociopath, eh? Regardless, by this definition, I am certainly a sociopath, so perhaps Christian was correct.\r\n\r\nMy blatant misunderstanding of the importance of a human life could be seen by many as sociopathic (or psychotic) behaviour. I have considered this very natural feeling of mine exemplified by the brief episode when I was young described above many times. Another example is that I find most mammalian life just as important as human life on a one-for-one basis. I am unattached by blood. My importance of people in general is directly proportional to my mental connection with them. That\'s not to say that I wouldn\'t just as easily murder someone close to me as opposed to a stranger. The mental connection and its resulting importance just allows people to appear in my mind to be more pleasant to be around and easier to relate to.\r\n\r\nThis is also not to say that I would murder anyone, really.\r\n\r\nSo, in these regards, I am a sociopath.\r\n\r\nAnd what\'s wrong with it, really? Most deviants from a cultural or societal or even traditional norm are considered at one point or another sociopaths. I come back to a deal I made with myself over and over again at times in the past. Those who grate against the norm and blatantly fuck off the rules are by far the more interesting to get to know. Taking the easy path is rarely rewarding. Drifting into middle age makes one feel it is inevitable. What\'s the use in trying so hard as years pass, after all? Hm. Perhaps the more difficult it is, the more important it is. And certainly the more rewarding it is.','2011-01-12 23:59:59','2011-01-15 20:52:43'),(94,'Pinch my habitat','The Hawkwind binge has begun. I\'m four albums in if you count Hawklords. Specifically, I am listening to the live double I got at the oft frequented cd shop near Marienplatz in Munich. It is a live document of the tour supporting Choose Your Masques and reminds me greatly of April and May of 2000, especially living at the first hotel near Silberhornstrasse. I can still smell the oil I used for cooking in the tiny kitchen provided in my room in my mind. It was a scent which did not leave me or my clothing until I moved to the following residence provided by 12 Snap.\r\n\r\nI listened to this cd often then on *Thurk*, my Toshiba which was so resilient that it once survived my ex-wife throwing it across the motel room in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I prefer the memory of *Thurk* sitting on the desk in that room. The balcony was to my left. Perhaps the door was cracked to let in the late spring breeze. There was a bottle of vodka swiped from the party that an employee of 12 Snap invited Jenicek and I to the night or two before. (Probably the night before, as I quickly downed the bottle.) During those sequence of instants, I let the alcohol suffuse my corporeal essence, listened to this cd (and this very song - *Solitary Mind Games* - which seems pertinent as it most likely also did back then), and transcribed pages from my *Woodnotes* journal (now long lost in a cellar outside of Munich) into *Thurk*. Now the only way to reread that book would be to recover the hard drive which sits to my left at this moment. I\'d like to think it is possible to do so.\r\n\r\nI also purchased another **Hawkwind** title at the aforementioned cd shop. It is queued on Amarok.

The idea is to mute the sound slightly as it retreats from one ear to the apex between ears and then strengthen again as it approaches the other drum. Bang. Botch. Crackle. Toot of a horn. It is not a horn. It is a synthesizer. I am not fooled, though I am not perturbed. That decides it for me, unless I can quickly find an oboist and a bassoonist (or both combined into one, flesh-coloured object), sampled played by my fingers and sounded by my shittypie will suffice well enough for a gopher or perhaps a ground hog or even a prairie dog, none of which have yet been eaten by a Black Footed Ferret, which I\'d rather refer to as Mustela Nigripes.\r\n\r\n> The dream world that you\'ve found will one\r\n> day drag you down.\r\n\r\nAnother (and the final) excerpt from my first pocketmod:\r\n\r\n> Thousands of pods lie dead beneath the\r\n> trees.

Instead of growing slowly old as they trekked through a life filled with illusory purpose and ambition, they begin green and supple, sway time and time again in the wind, remain in their pods for warmth, but inevitably fall to the ground with the thin and ill-designed stem which connects their pod to a far more sturdy branch snaps and the breeze which once rocked them into a lulling daze whips them to the ground. There they slowly dry in the baking desert sun. Withering, they do not think or have aspirations for anything other than the fate they have been sent along to. It is easy for them to accept the slow piddling out of their lives because they are not taught by some monochrome culture to claw their way up to something greater...','2011-01-13 23:59:59','2011-01-15 20:59:46'),(95,'Droplets of mercurial thought','> Expert staff members working in the trenches\r\n> aren\'t always recognized as experts or paid \r\n> accordingly!\r\n\r\nThis brings me back to 12 Snap. I may not have been an expert by the definition that many people have, but I was towering over most at that company in knowledge of the workings of the system. This is very much true of the so called managers, who, though some came from a technical background, were dollops of oozing slime beneath the iron of mine and Jenicek\'s prowess. I recall one event where the bald-headed, short yet very overbearing manager named John Something would stand over Jenicek and take Jenicek into private conferences to criticize and demean. John did have a Java background, but was at a dead end creatively.\r\n\r\n> Not all expert staff want to end up as \r\n> managers!\r\n\r\nNow this point is beyond the comprehension of most existing management and for sure from any owners or marketing individuals. You see, anyone who is not climbing the ladder to financial success as quickly as possible is somehow not thinking correctly and certainly not directing his or her life in an intelligent manner. Why is it so difficult to accept that some do not want this, but are happy to flourish and grow in a role which will let them be much more creative and intellectually active (ie, a developer)?\r\n\r\nDreariness washes over me. Tomorrow morning, I shall drive to Austin if the powers that be let me rent a car with my flimsy little debit card. The limitations placed on people who are not wrapped in a shawl of financial success is the most prominent in the United States. In Europe, I had no problem doing and getting what I wanted without bizarre glances and constant suspicion. What causes this pall of paranoia which affects most humans in this country? How can I escape it?\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple and no matter how many times my parents try to emotionally blackmail me into staying with them, I must leave again. I was happier outside of the United States. Why should I stifle my happiness by staying? Why do people who insist they love you tie you to a rock at the edge of a lapping ocean at low tide? Why do they do this out of caring? It makes no sense. The adage if you love someone, let them free is certainly true, but so idealistic that I do not even break into the most menial smirk.\r\n\r\nSo, if the powers that be do rent me a vehicle, I shall be able to begin my sojourn away from this place one more time. Initially, it will be Austin. I\'ll happily roost there for the time being. My freedom will be claimed because I shall be living with strangers affording me a clean slate and giving me a new start in a familiar place. The coincidence that one of the rooms I may choose is very near the house in which Acy and I once lived makes me smile. If I move in there, I\'ll be very happy to walk those streets once more, possibly in a drunken stupor (though the reader must know at this time that I was never in any state but sober during the time I lived in that area of Austin). Maybe I\'ll even try to find that old laundromat for nostalgic reasons. I wonder what I did there whilst washing clothing. Did I read? Did I sulk? All I recall is that the process of hauling the clothing there, cleansing them, and hauling them back was a chore which was not looked forward to. I am sure I recollect times when all that was left to wear was soiled and smelly from the stifling summer heat. It was the summer of 1990. There was no hot water. I took a cold shower each morning. My body became used to it. I did not mind. I never asked Acy if he did or didn\'t. He never said anything to the best of my knowledge. Then there was Elke the pit bull. Yikes!\r\n\r\nListening to *X In Search Of Space* by **Hawkwind** reminds me of the Xmas I came back to Fort Stockton after first going to University in Austin in 1989. I had the lp and I played it on the rickety turntable in my room at that house which still haunts my dreams so many years later. (Oh - how childhood is the major force behind so many of the images in my dreams!) And, on the way to MAF on the aeroplane, I had *Paradox* from *Hall of the Mountain Grill* (and most likely the remainder of the album, as well) playing in my ears. This band was a big part of the soundtrack of 1989 - 1993, and contributed much to later years, as well. There is an entry in the possibly lost *Elaborations* journal I used to write on picard.tamu.edu which details an all-nighter at Microsoft in Redmond during which I was attempting to finish some sort of templating system in Java. I can still hear *Church Of Hawkwind*.

So, on to the Mellotron part. I shall return shortly.','2011-01-16 21:17:47','2011-01-16 21:17:47'),(98,'I bumped off the sheriff','As I said in one dream I had as a child:\r\n\r\n> I have happily created a portion of a piece\r\n> of art and can bask in this realization until\r\n> it comes to pass that the itch must again be\r\n> scratched and a following piece of art be\r\n> produced.\r\n\r\nI\'ve successfully stuck with the minimalistic character of the piece that was evident in its inception as *AcyBob* and has carried itself through the parts and transformations therein. *Part V* contains a bastardization of the bastardization in *Part III* of the melody in *Part I* played on the bass and \'bassoon\'. The only other non-percussive instrument is the *Mellotron*. I am getting closer to the end of this. Each part is easier to write. Each contains more and more material which has already been written. Good for them.\r\n\r\n#### And there is space!\r\n\r\nIt\'s not **space rock**, but there is space. The piece definately needs space after parts two and three (there are more contrasts and lulls in part four, giving the initial exhalation after the relentless first three parts).\r\n\r\nThe next task is *Part VI*. I already have a sketch of it in my mind. It begins with the bassoon playing `/e f ees/ e`, `/ees f e/ ees`, `/e f ees/ e`, and `/f ees e/ f`. These are each repeated six times (making three measures of 4/4 each and following the triplety *Part II* \'template\'). On the final note of each small sequence, IE, on beats **two** and **four**, the rhodes will play **F major7** and **Bes major7** alternately. These chords will be accompanied by a bass note which is not necessarily related to the chord.\r\n\r\nSo, a film and then to sleep. Tomorrow (later today, yah) finds me on a short journey to Odessa and the dermatologist.','2011-01-17 00:20:15','2011-01-17 00:20:15'),(99,'El Nombre','I must name the album. I must do it now. So what shall the album\'s name be? Hm. Well, what is the theme, exactly? We have which titles so far?\r\n\r\n* Intersection\r\n* Filter\r\n* Cycle\r\n* She Ain\'t My Girl\r\n* Union\r\n* Untitled\r\n* Fold\r\n* Untitled\r\n\r\nThe obvious conclusion is to title the album something regarding sets. So, what does *set theory* come up with when typed into the mighty **Google**, **Wikipedia** and **Thinkexist**. The results are, respectively:\r\n\r\nHm. Well, actually, that did not work very well, so let\'s attempt putting all of the song titles (including the untitled ones, just for amusement\'s sake) simultaneously into google and see what happens.\r\n\r\nAgain, nothing.\r\n\r\nMy cupped palms have come up empty.','2011-01-18 00:16:33','2011-01-18 00:20:27'),(100,'Reduction','As I was attempting to fall asleep at approximately 1.00 in the morning, I was musing over the last piece of the album. It\'s name is **Reductive**, since there is a many to one mapping from each of the other pieces to it. I have also decided to title the other *Untitled* piece **Injective** since all of its themes can be mapped exactly to one theme of the following piece, **Fold**. Well, actually, we\'ll see about that name later.\r\n\r\n##### So back to the purpose of this entry.\r\n\r\nI was musing also during the morning hours about **Reductive**. It will be in *7/4*. A single bassoon note will begin. All alone, it will paint the initial two measures. The bass will begin on the third beat of the third measure, playing a repeating pattern which lasts three beats. Well, much like this:\r\n\r\n    (Elegant elk?)\r\n    Layout    | * * * * * * * | * * * * * * * | * * * * * * * |\r\n    Bass      |     x x x     |     x x x     |     x x x     |\r\n    Rhodes    |         x x   |         x x   |         x x   |\r\n    Bassoon   | - - - - x - - | x - - x - - - | - x - - - x - |\r\n\r\nThe *x*s are the beats on which the instruments play. The *-*s in the case of the *Bassoon* are a continuous note, the *x*s being the places where the note changes. I\'ll possibly keep this same rhythm, in the spirit of minimalism, throughout, though variegating the harmony. With regard to the name **Reduction**, one theme from each previous piece will be included, scaled down and most likely transformed.','2011-01-18 20:36:15','2011-01-18 20:56:23');
