If I have to sit here all day doing nothing important, I shall squeeze my own liver out of my torso and feed it to the bastards who make me live a life which is unimportant.\r\n\r\nJenicek was far away. I remember that clearly. I watched my face in the mirror in the elevator as I descended to take my cigarette. My mind was on the future. On a future that was not particularly defined (everything now seemed to me wanted defined). Vesna was at home (was it home? not really) waiting. I passed time wasting the internet with my intentions. I got no further than earning money for doing nothing. Is it possible in this case, six years later? That is a fucking good question, my friend.\r\n\r\nPetr now describes some easy to understand concept on the white-board to Jan whilst I listen to Magma in the headphones Vladimir supplied me.

I invited her to go to a film tonight and she asked why I liked sitting down so much. She said she\'d go, but I have to go to power yoga with her in return. I told her I would not feel comfortable in a group exercise environment (which is certainly true) and she was patently offended, it seems.\r\n\r\nWe have been wavering. For a long time now.\r\n\r\nShe treated me with this emotional icyness in the past and I endured it, always building, hoping for better days. Perhaps I was wasting my time. Perhaps she was wasting hers, as well. It is certainly an indication that our relationship is on the rocks when what were once seen as only small cracks in my personality now must shield themselves from a torrential flood from her. So she is not happy. How to let it go?\r\n\r\nShe said she was looking for a new place to live. She said she wants to leave me. It hurt. It still does a bit, but the pain is waning.

It seems like years, decades. And she transforms herself into the one who can survive her run of the mill world, the world I am very rarely allowed to see - HoneybunÃƒÂ­&#269;ka land. I am not very happy about the September memory of her calling & messaging when she was drunk in Krnov. I was with Garth then and he shared my pain. I could see it in his face. I wonder what she was really doing, why she was really unavailable. And she accuses me of being suspicious. Oh yes, I am, and after the way she talks about her obsession with sex and the way she hides every other point of her social life from me -- who wouldn\'t be suspicious? I can think of no-one.

I was going to register something --- mayhap here, mayhap in yon journal, but it has escaped me. Shit.\r\n\r\nDefinately, this film burns like Acy\'s blowtorch to the leg of my cardtable back in 1991. You can feel the tension from the start. I am just to the point now where Jasper takes Faron to his place. They are about to smoke weed and listen to Radiohead. I remember so much. Fuck, that is a good idea. Oouh baby.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point is that the version of \'Goodbye Ruby Tuesday\' is sung by Franco Battiato. What the fuck kind of coincidence is that, my fine, feathered friend?\r\n\r\nI wonder when it is time to feel old. I think my parents <strong>insist</strong> that it should be soon. It was only last year that my mother mentioned to me that I should be passing into middle age soon. Stereotypes are fun, eh?\r\n\r\nThe conversation with Mike in early 1994 is important. There are people (like, as he said, Miles, who would grow old naturally and happily) who grow old and people who are damned to be young for the rest of their existence. That reminds me: I\'d be good to get in touch with him sometime soon, not only for nostalgic\'s sake.\r\n\r\nI think a large portion of the film is about forgetting people who are important. Well, perhaps that is just an ironic point of view. Ach Jo. What scratching impulse does one have when all one\'s friends have been murdered because of some absurd political reason?\r\n\r\nSo I am going to watch the remainder of the film and sadden myself because of its inhumanty.

Of course, I have written drivel similar to that sentence a multitude of times in the past, so it may not be immediately believed. Still, the feeling floods. The floorboards of my mind are sodden. The rafters will soon be entombed in the deluge.\r\n\r\nI have never been one to be held at bay.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in an email to LucÃƒÂ­a yesterday (or was it the day before?) something concerning rent in Buenos Aires. She did not reply. Only during our short discussion today via Skype was the subject breached. One of her initial questions was \'Are you serious this time?\' I suppose it was warrented. The last year has been rather jangly concerning the rusted, decrepit chains which hold me in Brno. I suppose the Rubicon has been crossed -- at least mentally. No going back now.\r\n\r\nMichal also expressed the desire to traverse the atlantic in early summer.

I soon found it that Woody Allen directed it. Well, I thought, at least there is that. He usually injects a bit of depth into his films. The story turned out to be quite unexpected. I was happily surprised.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, in the end, chooses a life which is more comfortable over a life which is unstable but arguably makes him much more happy/satisfied. The film does not take any sides on this issue. It does not judge his actions. It is just a statement of what is. And I believe what Allen is trying to portray is that most people, being put in the shoes of the protagonist, would choose the same.\r\n\r\nAnother point the film makes is that it is damn near impossible to pry yourself out of a complex life -- just walk away from it -- without your whole world turning on its head, even though doing so would make you more happy in the end. It\'s the transitional phase that would suck. Badly.\r\n\r\nI never want to choose what is comfortable over what would ultimately be more satisfying.

The keys of my laptop click in unison with my thoughts. It\'s a simple day full of sensory input usually ignored. The small click of the joints on my glasses as I straighten them even sounds monstrous to me.\r\n\r\nI am floating in a haze.

At one point there will be an ostinato during which the mandolin will play the melody repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIn the background I envision sustained electric guitar notes.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a simple beginning.

It is my current goal.\r\n','2008-10-03 10:02:37','2008-10-03 10:02:37'),(39,'Angelica','Marcie is obsessed with this song. We are at her house, in her room (upon the carpet that I gleefully bought and installed) discussing it. She lounges on her bed as I sit before the stereo. Our relationship is knitting together unlike it ever did before.\r\n\r\nThe civilized gentleman is gonna be nice.\r\n\r\nIt is the peak. All is downhill from here. I skip my classes. I do everything to satisfy my obsession to be with her. Her parents approve. At first, this bewildered me, but then came as a natural thing. Adaptability has always been one of my strong traits.\r\n\r\nThen there is the paper route. This album permeates the smallish space within my truck (even more confined from the presence of the multitudes of rolled papers piled wherever room can find them). There is also King Crimson \'The Great Deceiver\' in these days. Endless hours of hated yet enjoyed rollings with friends.\r\n\r\nAngelica - stop making up those lies!\r\n','2008-10-03 10:07:49','2008-10-03 10:07:49'),(40,'Lost','Jayson, Tony and I (and perhaps others who are unnamed) drive in Austin near MoPac. I think We are going to see some concert or another, or perhaps driving for the simple hell of it. I am not driving. Tony is. Tony has never been the best driver. Jayson says this is a fucking hit. I deny it. I say no. He snarls at me for liking something which could possibly be popular. I am uncomfortable, but I have not found the part of me yet which lets me be comfortable for loving what I wish to love no matter the thoughts of others. No more details.','2008-10-03 10:23:48','2008-10-03 10:23:48'),(41,'The Disillusionist','I am making a tape for Marcie. Tony comments that this song is not the best on the album, I should\'ve chosen something better. I am not sure why he makes this comment. Perhaps because this is the one I would be the most attracted to, or perhaps it is the most shocking lyrically. I am a very lyrical person at this point. Mostly, I want Marcie to be wide eyed at the shocking things Steve Kilbey is singing of. I am, I admit, attempting to impress because she submerges herself in words that singers croon no matter the music, atmospheric, jaunty or bland. If I were to choose my favourite, it\'d be \'Lustre\', not only because of the forefront words, but its delivery and its mystique. It takes some time, but the ambient quality of The Church\'s music is what entrances.\r\n\r\nI listen again and again and I am taken back to 1991, alone again in my room, disappointed, perhaps thinking how to impress Chris Johnson (with his alternative tastes). It protruded into later life, as I have presentiments of the future in the dorm room with Kierstinn as she criticizes whilst her roommate plays this album. She\'s bored. I am moving from one distant past to another. I protest. Her roommate flees (possibly because of the noise we had made the night before below her bunk) and the music stops. Silence. \'Let\'s listen to AC/DC\', she suggests.\r\n','2008-10-03 11:08:39','2008-10-03 11:08:39'),(42,'Tristesse','It plays again, this time with Marty Willson-Piper singing. I expect this song to be there at my funeral.','2008-10-03 11:09:55','2008-10-03 11:12:08'),(43,'You Took','I am sitting in the dorm, I forget its name. Tony is gone to class. I set up the equipment. We are recording an absurd and beautiful tape full of songs we have not written but with mappings of our own present present. There are speaking parts. There is Tony flagellating with his bass. This is the final song and I place bizarre soundscapes over it. Tony plays along.\r\n\r\nIt is a constructive time for us. There is the microphone, suspended from a cable from some nut in the ceiling. We play over and over, though I know he is exasperated at my energy. He has other concerns. One piece, one that runs through my head 15 years later, over and over again, is written on paper (in the future, I think I still have most of it, though I am uncertain - unable to unearth with my clouded mind, the truth) and we play it. I push for (over and over again - for I am insistent) a great end to it. It never happens.\r\n\r\nI wonder now what happened to those recordings of \'Upon Awakening\', especially part ... V, was it? I struggled with the keyboard part over and over and it beautified our days for a short time. The whole never made the light of day, though we did revisit it during concerts the next year (though only parts I-II _& III).\r\n\r\nThose days cannot have been wasted. Were Tony here and had no other commitments, we\'d redo it. I know. The knoll beckons. And part of it is still stuck in my head.\r\n','2008-10-03 11:45:27','2008-10-03 11:45:27'),(44,'Monday Morning','Bryce and I are sitting in his car outside of Conan\'s Pizza (in the back, actually). Both of us are silent, listening to the song.\r\n\r\n\'Hundreds of chances, you blew every one\'<br />\r\n\'Dice rolled ... double 6 double 6 double 6 double 6\'<br />\r\n\'Owner of trouble ... flesh blood and bricks\'\r\n\r\nThose lyrics took the two of us through his drunken days an Conan\'s Pizza and our time to make music together (especially \"Walk in the Park\" and \"Ejection\") and destroyed me as he left. The crazy ambience in his garage as he screamed \'Cutting the Reins of a Dream\' and Tony jarred the ambiance with bass and I struggled to find the correct keys on my Roland still claws at my brain. I would like to hear those tapes, as raw as they may be.\r\n\r\nHe disappeared, perhaps, in the same way as Raun, scared of the idea of our insanity, or of my fanaticism. When I (which I only very occasionally do) think about him...\r\n\r\nHe was a good friend.\r\n','2008-10-03 11:59:14','2008-10-03 12:06:38'),(45,'Cut In Two','Sitting in the Southeast of Houston on my paper route, I listen to this, wondering why I hadn\'t rolled enough papers for the night. I sigh and chalk it all up to absurdity. The Boss, whose name I forget, will be very angry at me tomorrow, for 5 or 6 papers will not be delivered. The clients shall call and complain. I shall be disparaiged.','2008-10-03 12:16:09','2008-10-03 12:16:09'),(46,'Kings','So now comes the best song by this band, the band I have loved for years and years. They should know it.\r\n\r\nA joy comes. Truth. Love of song is immortal.\r\n\r\nAn infant with the voice of a crone<br />\r\nIn Nebachanezar\'s parking zone<br />\r\nCalls out my lord... your end is nigh<br />\r\nI didn\'t mean to make you cry<br />\r\nIn deserts where the dust storm blows<br />\r\nAnd lush black swamps where mandrake grows<br />\r\nWe\'re marching, laughing to the drum<br />\r\nWaiting for those kings to come<br />\r\nThe circus sun in Nero eyes<br />\r\nThe lions and the Christians rise<br />\r\nSoftware sings and hardware hears<br />\r\nWe\'re destined babe to live these years \r\n\r\nFucking excellent.\r\n','2008-10-03 12:18:12','2008-10-03 12:29:18'),(47,'Peter Gabriel','After careful consideration (years of research) I have come to the conclusion that Peter Gabriel\'s third solo album is my favourite.','2008-10-14 10:32:43','2008-10-14 10:32:43'),(48,'Alone','I wonder if Jenicek is reading this.\r\nTime is apparent.\r\nIt slides rationally. I miss him. He was a direct stable point in my life. Now, all is insanity.\r\n\r\nIt is gone. Goodbye.','2008-10-17 10:15:46','2008-10-17 10:15:46'),(49,'Lucid days','Well, lucidity is running strong through all of my days. I concentrate on such things as Abstract Algebra and comprehend quickly as opposed to times when I fooled myself into believing I could learn and remember pretty much anything whilst my mind was muddied. That was very often throughout the last years, I am afraid.\r\n\r\nHere is something I\'d love to do:\r\nGo through \"Beelzebub\'s Tales to his Grandson\" slowly and write comments about the text and pursue thoughts which it ignites in my mind. This is an aim I shall begin tomorrow.\r\nThat\'s Tuesday, baby! 18 November 2008: Another day of lucidity.','2008-11-17 22:11:11','2008-11-17 22:11:11'),(50,'The clouds graze my day','Meditation comes in a peculiar form for me. It often involves long walks alone, sometimes aimlessly, through the city streets and many twisting paths of its green areas. The sensation is calming and that is why I place it under what I see as the broad banner of \'meditation\'.\r\n\r\nThe rush of hours always brings a tightness to my chest, as if my heart and lungs were constricted. When I am pressed by outside influences into a schedule, I sweat. I shake and tremble. I am a wreck.\r\n\r\nThe solitary walks (at times with music singing in my ears and at times without) have no routine or schedule. There is nowhere I must be at any particular moment. I am not only with myself, but outside of myself, at one with my environment, if you will. This is true even if there is music singing in my ears.\r\n\r\nI find that when that tightness comes, I am hurrying through the day not for me, not for the sensation of being alive as a whole, but always for someone else. Always. Perhaps it is a selfish sensation about which I write. It is the selfishness of wanting to be outside of oneself, methinks. For the press which others exert on one\'s schedule destroys any beauty of the moments one passes throughout the day.\r\n\r\nSolitary walks.\r\nMeditation.\r\n','2008-11-20 15:24:13','2008-11-20 15:24:13'),(51,'The jingle jangle of home','A few days ago, I exited tram 25 at Letenske Namesti. I was on my way to Chris\'s office because he was, as usual, running behind. The original plan was to synchronize a meeting at Vltavska (that is, I was to hop on a tram he was already on). It was scrapped. As I shuffled down the three steps and onto the pavement, I saw a shimmering reflection of light fall and clink sadly on the ground. A lady had dropped her keys. The keychain was a green bottle opener fastened to a ring. There were three keys on the ring. Another woman asked someone quickly if the keys were theirs, but got no reply. They lay stepped on and generally ignored during the following seconds. So I grabbed them. I walked to the crossing where I knew the lady to be - most who disembarked went that direction. I didn\'t know exactly which person the keys belonged to and was readying myself to proclaim I\'d found lost keys and were they any of yours... I was lucky. The first lady I spoke two claimed them. At my \'prosim\', she looked at me, startled and actually a bit frightened, I believe. When she saw the keys, relief shown in her face, however.\r\n\r\nI relate this because I thought about it several times in the ensuing hours. Had I done nothing, I believe I\'d have been guilt ridden for much of the remaining day. Surely the feeling would have eventually passed (by evening, probably) but I\'d have felt the pangs (like echoes strong but waning in power one after another). So, in the end, it was a selfish act. Is this what motivates the saint? The wish to wash away any possibility of negative feelings spawns the desire to aid others?\r\n','2008-11-21 16:00:11','2008-11-21 16:00:11'),(52,'Scraping the ice from the forebrain','If there is a greater force which occasionally tests me, I\'m all for it to do so as often as possible. It\'s good for me. It deletes lethargy. It drums up positive emotions. I\'m up for the challenge. Let\'s go for it.\r\n','2008-11-22 22:48:02','2008-11-22 22:48:02'),(53,'She\'ll come back for you tomorrow','I sit on an aeroplane bound for Atlanta from Praha, sweet Praha. When shall I see Praha again? Well, I am banished for two years, so the minimum sentence of exile is at least obvious. My only connection is this small shittypie which accompanies me. The Smaller One was left dry eyed at the aeroport, receding as my footsteps took me towards gate B8. She worried for me. I was locked up as a result of my last attempt to fly from the country to my dreaded \"homeland\".\r\n\r\nAs I listen to the voices (mostly the accents) sneak in between two tunes by The Church, I cringe psychologically. I am going back.\r\n\r\nI spoke to her on the telephone mere minutes before departure. I sat in this slowly warming seat. I am still displaced in space, however. I attempt not to think of her return to the flat in HÃ…Â¯rka and the disturbing presence of ghosts she will feel throughout the next weeks, possibly longer. It is remindful of the insanity of Melanie leaving me in Austin in a flat filled with items we routinely shared. I recall doing my best to uncork the blackness and let it flood over me with intention that doing so might quench it. I don\'t recall my results and the journal which holds them is long lost in a basement near Muenchen.\r\n\r\nShe\'ll stare at the empty space in front of the range, imagining wisps of me coalescing and then fragmenting into swirls of smoke from the pan slightly charring topinky. I\'ll be in two places at once. She\'ll reach in her sleep with her paw to the space warmed strangely by the continuousness of my presence over the months but cooling ever so slightly evening after evening. Whether she awakes with the lack of touch or not, there will be a penetrating sting.\r\n\r\nShe\'ll awake with longing.\r\n\r\nAnd wherever I am, I\'ll do much the same, but to cold sheets holding a vanished phantasm from a dream.\r\n','2009-03-30 12:12:14','2009-03-30 12:12:14'),(54,'Far Away (So Close)','I shall not begin the film yet, but instead watch the most recent episode of Lost, saving Wim Wenders for after the meal.\r\n\r\nA glare threatens to wash out shittypie\'s contrast.\r\n','2009-03-30 12:14:28','2009-03-30 12:14:28'),(55,'An interesting quote','There is no difference between men and women.

It is one I\'ll see many times in my life, finding arousing details each subsequent watch. I\'m not sure how far we have progressed on our flight. Static in a chair, I feel as if I never left Praha at all.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how I\'ll feel when I reach ground zero. I want to be in transit forever. Perhaps I am the happiest when I am on the move, when the ending is uncertain, or when the ending is so far away that I\'ll never see it in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nI am talking about a personal ending, of course, and not a universal one.\r\n','2009-03-30 16:15:00','2009-03-30 16:15:00'),(57,'Deep in the heart of the South, baby','My buttocks ache against the padded seat whilst Eliza, or at least the curved part of her, presses to the dingy wall. Shittypie, my only constant friend, sucks power from the socket in the wall like a parasite. It is needed energy for us both. Boredom on the two and a half hour flight from Atlanta to Houston is the enemy.\r\n\r\nDepending on delays that have so far plagued my journey incessantly, I may have something sucked from ME after my arrival. That thing being money. I shall have to stay the night in that dreaded city - in an overly expensive hotel near the aeroport, surely (going into the city would be asinine) - if I miss the connection to Midland. Perhaps it would be fitting for my first night in the dreaded homeland after a thirty-nine month absence, almost to the day. Whichever happens, I shall be sure to record it here to be stored away in the entries table of the polaris database on the stoat-shittypie.\r\n\r\nBoarding will begin soon.\r\n\r\nThe Smaller One lies in bed, most likely sleeping. As I wandered the terminal approximately an hour ago and whilst I ate a feeble crispy chicken sandwich at an unnamed fast food joint, I felt displaced as I have not since surely the atrocious six months I spent in this country during the first half of 2003. I felt frightened of being in bed in Seminole and attempting to sleep. The dread faded as it was gradually supplanted by weariness. The latter is winning. I count it a blessing.\r\n\r\nI am thinking of her. Our shibboleth chants its mantras in my mind.\r\n\r\nBoarding has begun.\r\n','2009-03-31 00:26:47','2009-03-31 00:26:47'),(58,'I am not fond of cataracts','I sit up in bed in Seminole, Texas. I\'m on the wrong side of the bed. Were I back in Praha, this is where the Smaller One would be whilst the other \'half\' would belong to me.\r\n\r\nI scurried not unlike a rodent from the aeroplane bound for Houston (in which i was misfortunately seated at the back) to a shuttle bus which whisked me, a southern lady muttering obscenities under her breath, and several others to Terminal B. The route it took did not seem to me to be very direct. I had about fifteen minutes to catch my flight to Midland. Terminal B is vast. However, a spritely lady in a cart bearing one other human bade me to hop aboard and careened through the terminal\'s labyrinth towards my gate. So the joys of serendipity brought me to the plane.\r\n\r\nYesterday was the first full day with my parents. An immediate observation is that they have a problem with silence. On our drive to Hobbs to secure me a new social security card, they filled the silence with repeated observations of the surrounding landscape and its owners, uses, history, etc. I feel my father is very uncomfortable when no communication is present between him and people surrounding him. He also does his best to greet and meet anyone in the vicinity during visits to shops, the post office, and en-route from his vehicle to any location. Perhaps it is the requisite \'West Texan Friendliness\' I was raised with to reject. Perhaps that is extreme, but I find the whole idea superficial. He, on our short drive to Wal Mart yesterday morning to purchase a wireless router, even came out and said it explicitly. The blacks call it \'Jive Talk\' and the white locals call it \'Bullshit\'. Small talk is the common term. Locals do it with a casual vigor. Certainly it is not an inherited trait. Small town culture suffuses folk. As usual, I shall not partake. I hope my directness does not confuse or irritate any of my parents\' friends, but though I am a much more accepting and tolerant person than in my \'youth\', I shall not let my brain grow torpid.\r\n\r\nAranis plays on last.fm radio.

It never occurs here. I am perpetually sated. Unhealthiness shall follow, for there is no opportunity to exercise. I need escape. Soon.\r\n\r\nSo, as my mind is muddled, unclear, unsharp - most likely from the same catalysts that begot my physical lackadaisicalness - I shall watch a film. Perhaps it will pull me in.
